# Real-Time-Object-Recognizing-Voice-Assistant-For-Blind
With the use of Deep neural network in OpenCV objects are detected in real time and gives voice output. This will help blind people to move around independently.
This can be developed as standalone system by implementing the ssame on Raspberry pi.
